# üßπ Git History Cleanup Plan

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Current files are clean (no hardcoded passwords)
- .gitignore updated with security rules
- Pre-commit hooks configured
- Security documentation created
- Template files renamed (.env.migration ‚Üí .env.migration.example)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue
**Git history contains hardcoded passwords in these commits:**

1. **Commit 00e5a89** - "üéØ Create Migration Control Center with intelligent workflow management"
   - File: `test_migration_center.py`
   - Password: `testpass`

2. **Commit 00e5a89** - Same commit
   - File: `test_env_update.py`
   - Password: `mypassword`

3. **Commit 31eb8f1** (deleted file)
   - File: `adar_compare.py`
   - Status: File was deleted, but history remains

## üéØ Cleanup Options

### Option 1: Full History Rewrite (Recommended if passwords were real)

**Use this if:**
- Passwords were real credentials
- You want complete security
- You can coordinate with team to re-clone

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Backup repository
cd ..
cp -r Migration Migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 2. Run automated cleanup script
cd Migration
./security_cleanup.sh

# 3. Follow prompts to:
#    - Fix current files (already done)
#    - Run BFG Repo-Cleaner
#    - Force push to GitHub

# 4. Notify team to re-clone
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Complete removal of passwords from history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires team to re-clone repository
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rewrites all commit SHAs after the affected commits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaks any existing pull requests

---

### Option 2: Partial Cleanup (If passwords were test/fake only)

**Use this if:**
- Passwords were only test/fake values
- You want to minimize disruption
- Risk is acceptable

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Document the issue
# Already done in SECURITY_SUMMARY.md

# 2. Ensure current files are clean
# Already done ‚úÖ

# 3. Monitor for future issues
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# 4. Enable GitHub secret scanning
# Go to Settings ‚Üí Security & analysis
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ No team disruption
- ‚úÖ Current files are clean
- ‚ö†Ô∏è History still contains test passwords
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable if passwords were never real

---

### Option 3: Repository Reset (Nuclear option)

**Use this if:**
- Real credentials were exposed
- You want a fresh start
- History is not critical

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Create new repository
# 2. Copy current clean files
# 3. Initialize new git history
# 4. Push to new repository
# 5. Archive old repository
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Complete fresh start
- ‚úÖ No history issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loses all git history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires updating all references

## üîß Detailed Cleanup Instructions

### Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Install BFG

```bash
# macOS
brew install bfg

# Linux
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar
alias bfg='java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar'

# Windows
# Download JAR from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
```

#### Step 2: Create Backup

```bash
cd /Users/adar.bahar/Code/Migration-current
cp -r Migration Migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
cd Migration
```

#### Step 3: Create passwords.txt

```bash
cat > passwords.txt << 'EOF'
testpass==>REDACTED_PASSWORD
mypassword==>REDACTED_PASSWORD
pass123==>EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
secret==>EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
EOF
```

#### Step 4: Run BFG

```bash
# Replace passwords in all history
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt

# Review changes
git log --oneline | head -20
```

#### Step 5: Clean Git

```bash
# Expire reflog
git reflog expire --expire=now --all

# Garbage collect
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

#### Step 6: Verify

```bash
# Search for passwords in history
git log --all -S "testpass" --oneline
git log --all -S "mypassword" --oneline

# Should return no results
```

#### Step 7: Force Push

```bash
# Push to GitHub (rewrites history!)
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

#### Step 8: Notify Team

Send this message to your team:

```
üîí Security Update: Git History Cleaned

The repository history has been rewritten to remove hardcoded passwords.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Delete your local Migration repository
2. Re-clone from GitHub:
   git clone https://github.com/AdarBahar/Migration.git
3. Update your .env file with credentials
4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install

DO NOT:
- Try to pull/merge your old repository
- Push from your old repository
- Use your old local copy

Questions? See SECURITY_CLEANUP.md
```

### Using git-filter-repo (Alternative)

#### Step 1: Install

```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

#### Step 2: Create Replacements File

```bash
cat > replacements.txt << 'EOF'
literal:testpass==>REDACTED_PASSWORD
literal:mypassword==>REDACTED_PASSWORD
literal:pass123==>EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
literal:secret==>EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Run Filter

```bash
git filter-repo --replace-text replacements.txt
```

#### Step 4: Re-add Remote

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/AdarBahar/Migration.git
```

#### Step 5: Force Push

```bash
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

## üìã Pre-Cleanup Checklist

Before running cleanup:

- [ ] **Backup repository** - Copy entire directory
- [ ] **Notify team** - Warn about upcoming changes
- [ ] **Check for open PRs** - They will be broken
- [ ] **Document current state** - Save commit SHAs
- [ ] **Verify passwords** - Are they real or test?
- [ ] **Plan downtime** - If needed for team coordination
- [ ] **Test cleanup** - On backup copy first

---

## üìã Post-Cleanup Checklist

After running cleanup:

- [ ] **Verify history** - Search for passwords
- [ ] **Test repository** - Clone fresh copy
- [ ] **Update documentation** - Note the cleanup
- [ ] **Rotate credentials** - If passwords were real
- [ ] **Notify team** - Send re-clone instructions
- [ ] **Monitor GitHub** - Check for security alerts
- [ ] **Install pre-commit** - Prevent future issues
- [ ] **Enable scanning** - GitHub secret scanning

## üö® If Passwords Were Real

### Immediate Actions (Do Now!)

1. **Rotate ALL credentials immediately**
   ```bash
   # Change Redis Cloud passwords
   # Change AWS credentials
   # Change any other exposed credentials

   # Review security groups
   ```

4. **Clean git history** (use Option 1 above)

5. **Document incident**
   - What was exposed
   - When it was exposed
   - Who had access
   - What actions were taken

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Current Files

```bash
# Search for passwords in current files
grep -r "password.*=.*['\"]" --include="*.py" . | grep -v "EXAMPLE_PASSWORD\|your-password\|<password>"

# Should return no results
```

### Check Git History

```bash
# Search for specific passwords
git log --all -S "testpass" --oneline
git log --all -S "mypassword" --oneline

# Search for password patterns
git log --all -G "password.*=.*['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" --oneline
```

### Use Security Scanners

```bash
# Install gitleaks
brew install gitleaks

# Scan repository
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose --report-path gitleaks-report.json

# Review report
cat gitleaks-report.json
```

```bash
# Install truffleHog
pip install trufflehog

# Scan repository
trufflehog filesystem . --only-verified --json > trufflehog-report.json

# Review report
cat trufflehog-report.json
```
